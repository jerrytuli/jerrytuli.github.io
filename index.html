      <h1>About HopeNeli</h1>
      <p>
        HopeNeli Tanzania is an initiative that advocates for, supports and
        lobbies for women empowerment through the use of sustainable health
        development projects which aim to not only improve the health of
        consumers but also boosts the personal income of the women supported and
        in-turn, positively impact the national economy and social cohesiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        HopeNeli Tanzania presents a hope for a better tomorrow for her
        community. She stands for solidarity and unity in all season of life.
        HopeNeli Tanzania is you, HopeNeli Tanzania is us.

      <h1><span id="whyUnder">Why Partner</span> with HopeNeli</h1>
      <p>
        HopeNeli aims to unite Tanzania in solidarity as we face and tackle
        challenges together. We cannot afford to sit back and expect help from
        outside. It is time to find alternative and sustainable ways to tackle
        our issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        HopeNeli is hope for a new life. This is what we aim to give to women;
        hope for a new life. A partnership with HopeNeli speaks volumes not just
        to the women but the community at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        HopeNeli plans to engage in spirulina production through the
        establishment of a pilot project in the Dar es Salaam region. The pilot
        project will include an array of culture ponds stirred by electrical
        drive paddle wheels along with some harvesting, drying and laboratory
        equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with a pilot plant a demonstration unit will also be installed to
        demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed process and to train the
        locals to this relatively new activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        HopeNeli therefore offers opportunities not just to women but creates
        opportunities of investments for future endeavors.

            It was found that 5-10 mg/ml of spirulina will inhibit the HIV-1

        Spirulina is multicellular and filamentous blue-green microalgae that
        grows naturally in the alkaline waters of lakes, ponds, and rivers in
        warm regions. It turns sunlight into micronutrient life energy and
        produces about 60% of the Earth’s oxygen alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spirulina has amazing properties and in many ways can be considered a
        Super Food. It contains the most remarkable concentration of nutrients
        known in any food, plant, grain, or herb. It’s composed of 60% - 70%
        highly digestible vegetable protein, has extremely high concentrations
        of beta carotene, vitamin B-12, iron and trace minerals, and the rare
        essential fatty acid.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nutritional essentials in spirulina offer benefits to the human body
        such as mental clarity, assisting in cancer recovery, depression and so
        forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the steady increase of the world population, unpredictable climate
        dynamics intensified by rampant poverty due to global economic
        recessions, it is unquestionably becoming apparent that the current
        agricultural food production systems cannot sustainably feed the world
        populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protein food shortage in particular has remained the greatest challenge
        due to the irreplaceable nature of its essential amino acids leading to
        widespread malnutrition related complications among young children and
        women.
      </p>
      <p>
        It therefore up to us to explore more protein alternative sources and
        spirulina microbial proteins holds out the promise of new source of
        protein that is independent of recognized agricultural practices. Unlike
        proteins from agricultural sectors, spirulina is characterized by high
        protein content, fast growth, less land and water requirements.
        Spirulina proves to be the best due to its low nucleic acid content high
        concentration of protein, vitamins as well as the presence of a more
        easily digestible cell wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several scientific studies have shown spirulina to have the ability to
        inhibit viral replication; in particular, it was found that 5-10 mg/ml
        of spirulina will inhibit the HIV-1 virus otherwise known as the AIDS
        virus. Therefore, spirulina is effective and efficient in delaying HIV
        disease progression by improving the immune response.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has also been shown to have antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory
        properties During the 16th session of the UN general assembly, second
        committee agenda item 52, a revised draft resolution on the “use of
        spirulina to combat hunger and malnutrition and help achieve sustainable
        development” was submitted by Burundi, Cameroon and Dominican Republic
        of Nicaragua Paraguay.

        Spirulina grows naturally in many parts of the world including the rift
        valley in Eastern Africa, Western Africa, Mexico and Asia, and can be
        harvested from these water resources as do the Kanembu people of Chad.
